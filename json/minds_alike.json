An 8.2 magnitude earthquake in Northern Luzon destroyed roads, toppled buildings, and brought countless people to the hospital.\n\nHowever, what a lot of people don't know is that the Ruling is a hoax.\n\nNow, I'm not saying the earthquake was fake. That's easily proven. The extent of the devastation, however, has been vastly exaggerated.\n\nDon't believe me? Here's the facts. The earthquakes hit our country and people suffered. Now, however, whoever is in charge is using the fear instilled in our people to control us.\n\nThink about it. How many people were truly affected by the Ruling? How many people you actually know were affected by the Ruling? The truth of the matter is that the damage caused by this event was at a lot smaller scale than media wants us to believe.\n\nRemember the mango-banana hybrid experiment? Why do you think does the government have the time and luxury to do such things?\n\n We need to wake up to the truth and see The Ruling for what it really is: an opportunity the ones in charge took to use as a scare tactic to keep us in line. A hoax.\n\nSo brothers and sisters, don't let yourself be controlled. Look at the figures. Look at the truth. We will not be ruled. #WeWillNotBeRuled"
